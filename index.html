                    WELCOME TO THE NEW WORLD
                </h2>
                <h3 style="margin: 0; font-size: 2vh;">
                    Welcome to the new post-apocalyptic world of the future, where every day could be your last, and the struggle for dwindling resources never stops. 
                    Once upon a time, the world plunged into chaos when newly created artificial intelligence declared war on all humanity. No one knows the reasons 
                    why this happened, there are many rumors ranging from the fact that the AI, originally aimed at correcting climate disasters, was decided to be used 
                    as a military machine, to the fact that the AI went crazy when the scientist who created it was killed in front of his eyes during attempts to forcefully 
                    take over. Many years have passed since humanity defeated AI and is gradually rebuilding cities and infrastructure. However, in the wastelands, beyond the 
                    reach of civilization, squabbling for resources and the struggle for survival continues. You are sent from the metropolis to capture a dance artifact.
                </h3>
                <h3 style="margin: 15px 0 0 0; font-size: 2vh;">
                    Unique turn-based strategy gameplay in the spirit of XCOM games with gacha elements! You have to recruit many robotic units, both provided to you by the 
                    factories of the metropolis, and by free androids who have lost their masters and roam the wastelands. Also, sometimes you can even find and tame machines 
                    of war that once ran under the command of a crazy AI. You need to carefully manage resources and ammunition in order to complete assigned tasks and get to 
                    the bottom of the secrets that the artifact contains. The gameplay, coupled with an interesting plot, will give you unforgettable emotions, and the interaction 
                    with your robotic protégés, indistinguishable from living people, will give you a lot of impressions and make you fall in love with these characters.

                                Not necessarily a company, "Pilgrim" is the collective term used to refer to Androids who live on the surface, unaligned with any of the metropolis 
                                big three companies. Most of the Pilgrims hail from the early days of the SFM' invasions, possessing technology, abilities, and knowledge no one in 
                                the metropolis has. While Pilgrims also fight for survival, they largely keep away from interacting with the metropolis and anyone who hails from it, 
                                thus the Central Government keeps an eye out for Pilgrims, apprehensive to their motives but also eager to claim their knowledge and technologies, by 
                                force if necessary. Because of these factors, the metropoli's knowledge regarding Pilgrims are little.

                                are now walking around the wasteland trying to survive. Androds produced by Sangvis Ferri Manufacturer are incredibly powerful opponents on the battlefield.
