                    Welcome to my blog dedicated to the class ARTDM-172-5955. As part of my assignment and as a personal journal, I use this blog to record the most interesting events and new discoveries.

                <h1>My first Team Meeting</h1>
                <h2>
                    On the very first day of our team’s formation, we decided as a class to create our own group on the social network Discord to facilitate communication and also to 
                    help each other with a variety of tasks, from homework to the banal sharing of information sources. I immediately really liked my two team members Maria and Jerek, 
                    it was very pleasant and easy to communicate with them and therefore we quickly found a common language. Maria immediately struck me as a very responsible person, 
                    while Jherek was very open to new ideas, so work on all projects promises to be very interesting, we are already looking forward to a new assignment.

                    The assignment came very quickly, literally a day later we had already chosen the topic that we should take as our main project to study, as well as for the implementation 
                    of which we would have to work. We have also compiled a meeting schedule so that we have up-to-date information for our assignments. We worked very well together.

                    In accordance with the assignment, we collect useful resources to use in our research. Today we learned how to ask reality check questions, and also compiled several 
                    possible questions for a future questionnaire that we will need to compile in accordance with our topic under study. We may have chosen a slightly more complex topic 
                    for analysis, but it is incredibly interesting.

                <h2>
                    We encountered a few difficulties while trying to compile the questionnaire. Due to the complexity of the topic, we were not sure how intimate the questions could be even 
                    in an anonymous questionnaire due to the high chance that people may either not want to answer the questions or may simply lie. After consulting with the professor, we decided 
                    to leave intimate questions in order to improve our audience’s deeper understanding.

                <h2>
                    After collecting all the results from the questionnaire, we began to create a rough idea of our target audience, or as it is commonly called a “persona”. The process turned out to be 
                    quite fun, as if we were creating a character for some kind of story. After thinking for some time, we decided to create two personas that would reflect our two possible audiences, a 
                    person who has been diagnosed with mental health problems, and someone who still cannot or is afraid to visit a professional and wants to take advantage of auxiliary resources. We argued 
                    for a long time about some of their features, but in the end we were able to come to a common opinion.

                <h1>Interactive prototype</h1>
                <h2>
                    We've finally come to the point of creating a prototype of our possible "solution". Working in Figma turned out to be much more fun than I thought. While Maria and Jerek made some pretty 
                    good Wireframes for our mobile app/website, it seemed to me that it lacked intuitiveness, and the design was clearly lame, so for the interactive prototype I decided to take matters into 
                    my own hands and redid it almost from scratch the whole appearance. I was glad that my team supported my efforts and that they clearly really liked the design, however we ran into a small 
                    problem due to the fact that the prototype was not very interactive and this may affect the results.

                <h1>Trial by Fire</h1>
                <h2>
                    Today, after many tests in the Maze program, as I thought, we encountered big problems in the form of a very large number of “missclicks” due to the low interactivity of the prototype. 
                    While this cannot be considered a complete data corruption, it did introduce some confusion into our data. I would really like to get rid of these flaws, but the very limited functionality 
                    of the application in the free version slows us down a lot, and the interface is terribly confusing and overcomplicated. However, we still began to compile our final report.

                <h2>
                    Today is our last day and our last meeting as a team this semester. Having compiled the last report, we said goodbye to each other and I don’t know if fate will ever bring us together again. 
                    However, I am sure that a bright future awaits them. During my studies, I managed to become very close to my fellow students and would like to wish them only success and good health, since 
                    without it, no knowledge will help you.

            <h1>Conclusion</h1>
            <h2>So what did I learn while studying this subject? In fact, a lot, but the most important thing is teamwork. I have always been not a very team player, preferring to do everything alone, but now I 
                have noticed how a fresh perspective can help in solving many problems, and also helps me look at things from completely different angles, which I probably would not have even thought of on my own. 
                I would also like to admit that, as it turned out at the beginning of the semester, I accidentally chose the wrong class, I wanted more practice and creating websites or web applications, but 
                ultimately I decided to test the theory, and I did not regret it at all. This class taught me to analyze data, correctly approach the selection of information and formulate ideas and prototypes 
                for further development. I would like to say a huge thank you to our professor Troy Bennett for his excellent feedback, interesting classes and such an interesting approach to learning.</h2>
